Recommendations:
- Prioritize updating dependencies to their latest, compatible versions that pass all builds and tests, while also manually reviewing and applying updates to the most secure versions available, even if this requires additional compatibility adjustments.
- Regularly conduct comprehensive security audits to promptly identify and address vulnerabilities within dependencies, incorporating both automated tools and expert reviews to ensure thorough coverage.
- Adopt secure coding practices throughout the development lifecycle to prevent the introduction of vulnerabilities, emphasizing code reviews, secure coding standards, and developer training on security best practices.
- Leverage automated testing, continuous integration, and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to maintain high standards of code quality and security, ensuring that any changes, including dependency updates, undergo rigorous testing before deployment.

Please consider the above recommendations to improve the security and stability of your project.
