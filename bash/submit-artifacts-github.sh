Hi there ğŸ‘‹,
I'm [Safer Bot](https://gitlab.com/lsi-ufcg/vulnerabilidades/safer)!
Safer is an open-source tool that automatically updates vulnerable dependencies to more secure and compatible versions. Our goal is to help maintainers keep their projects secure without breaking changes.
We ran Safer on your project at commit $commit and identified dependency updates that reduce vulnerabilities while preserving stability. Safer uses a compatibility-aware heuristic to select the most appropriate versions for each dependency.

Safer Report Summary: 

$safer_results

View the full Safer report [here]($safer_report_log_gist).

I'm excited to contribute to the open source community using our tool and would be happy to assist with any questions or feedback.
Feel free to reply to this issue and I'll respond as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Safer Bot
